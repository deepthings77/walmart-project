# Packaging Sustainability Optimizer

The **Packaging Sustainability Optimizer** is a Python-based tool designed to help organizations evaluate and optimize packaging materials based on various criteria such as cost, recyclability, carbon footprint, and durability. It uses advanced optimization techniques and offers both static and interactive visualizations to provide actionable insights.

## Features
- **Multi-Criteria Optimization**:
  - Optimize materials based on customizable weights for cost, recyclability, carbon footprint, and durability.
- **Visualizations**:
  - Static bar charts (matplotlib & seaborn).
  - Interactive visualizations with Plotly.
- **Export Results**:
  - Save optimization results to a CSV file.
- **Command-Line Arguments**:
  - Flexible configuration for weights and file paths.

## Setup
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python 3.7 or above installed on your system.

### Installation
1. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Sample Data
A sample dataset is provided in `example_data/packaging_data.csv` to help you get started.

### Running the Script
To run the optimizer:
```bash
python packaging_optimizer.py example_data/packaging_data.csv \
   --weight_cost 0.3 \  # Weight for cost efficiency (0.0 - 1.0, higher value = more focus on cost reduction)
  --weight_recyclability 0.4 \  # Weight for recyclability (0.0 - 1.0, higher value = more focus on recyclable materials)
  --weight_carbon_footprint 0.2 \  # Weight for minimizing carbon footprint (0.0 - 1.0, higher value = more focus on low-emission materials)
  --weight_durability 0.1 \  # Weight for durability (0.0 - 1.0, higher value = more focus on durable materials)
  --output_file results.csv  # Name of the file where results will be saved
```
<!-- 
 python "E:\walmart-project\Packaging Sustainability Optimizer\Packaging_Sustainability_Optimizer_Script.py" "E:\walmart-project\Packaging Sustainability Optimizer\material_data.csv" --output_file results.csv --weight_cost 0.3 --weight_recyclability 0.4 --weight_carbon_footprint 0.2 --weight_durability 0.1
 -->

## Input Data Format
The script expects a CSV file with the following columns:
- `Material`: Name of the material.
- `Cost_per_unit`: Cost per unit of the material.
- `Recyclability`: A score (0-1) indicating the recyclability of the material.
- `Carbon_Footprint`: The carbon footprint of the material.
- `Durability`: A score (0-1) indicating the durability of the material.

## Outputs
1. **Console Output**: Displays optimized materials and their scores.
2. **CSV Export**: Saves results to a specified output file.
3. **Visualizations**:
   - Static and interactive charts showing results and metric breakdowns.

## Example
Hereâ€™s an example of running the script with the sample data:
```bash
python packaging_optimizer.py example_data/packaging_data.csv
```
